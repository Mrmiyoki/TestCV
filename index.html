    <p>I am a founder at the Koala Academy for cutie lost koalas. The Koala's
      are very cute <strong>attention <u>whores</u></strong> that needs <strong><em>constant love all the time</em></strong>. They <strong>LOVE</strong>
      attention. They <strong><u>can't</u></strong> go one day without attention from their companion.
      That is how despecatio they are. Therefore, without the affection and love from their companion.
      <em><strong>Yes,</strong></em> they will hate including life, themselves, and their companion, until they get "charged".
      A little bit of feeding will do as well, but it won't be enough to make your koala
      stable again. You will need to give them kisses, compliment them, and even cuddle them.
      If you would like to learn more about the Koala Academy <em><small>asylum</small></em>,
      you can go to <a href="https://www.koalatherapies.com/"><em>Koala Academy.</em> This is also a joke test webpage so don't take it seriously.
      I love Koalas!</a>
